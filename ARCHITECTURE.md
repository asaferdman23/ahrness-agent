## Overview

```
Client (WhatsApp) ──► Agent (role-specific tools + skills + business context)
                            │
              ┌─────────────┼─────────────────────┐
              ▼             ▼                      ▼
         Meta Ads     Instagram Graph       Higgsfield / TikTok / Google
         MCP           API tools             MCP / API tools
```

Each client gets one agent instance per conversation, built dynamically from:
1. Their **business profile** (assets, goals, brand voice)
2. Their chosen **role** (defines which tools and skills load)
3. Their **connected platforms** (OAuth tokens per service)

---

## Onboarding Flow

Served at `/onboarding` from the existing Node.js process. The production flow is
a six-step Vite/TypeScript client backed by tenant-scoped JSON endpoints. Legacy
server-rendered views remain in `src/onboarding/server.ts` as a fallback, but
`frontend/onboarding/` is the current product surface.

The customer sees three phases while the six existing routes remain compatible:

1. **Brief** (step 1): business name, concise description, optional website and
   collapsed enrichment fields. A tool-free model creates a cached first-value
   preview; invalid output, timeout, or missing model configuration falls back
   to an honest deterministic starter plan.
2. **Configure** (steps 2–4): specialist, explicit routine choice, and progressive
   platform connections. Missing integrations identify unavailable capabilities
   but do not block the activation-v2 cohort from continuing.
3. **Launch** (steps 5–6): verified managed or linked WhatsApp setup, followed by
   three role-aware starter briefs and a prefilled WhatsApp action.

`ONBOARDING_ACTIVATION_V2_PERCENT` assigns sessions deterministically to the new
experience. The legacy cohort retains the six-step rail and hard integration gate.

### Onboarding readiness contract

The client never trusts the URL or an optimistic local step counter. The
bootstrap and status APIs return `progress`, derived by
`src/onboarding/progress.ts` from persisted state:

1. profile saved;
2. valid role saved;
3. automation decision saved (`scheduleTemplates` may intentionally be empty);
4. role-required platforms are reported as capability readiness, but are not a
   core launch gate for activation v2;
5. WhatsApp binding is verified, including the current Baileys socket state.

`progress.allowedStep` is the furthest trustworthy screen and
`progress.readiness` is one of `needs_profile`, `needs_role`,
`needs_automations`, `needs_connections`, `needs_whatsapp`, or `live`. POST
endpoints validate their own prerequisites; disabled client controls are not a
security boundary. The complete product and release plan is in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-18-production-onboarding.md`.

## Messaging Channels

WhatsApp is the primary channel; a client can additionally connect a personal
Telegram bot so the *same* agent (same profile, role, connections, memory) is
reachable there too.

### Baileys MVP group mode

Baileys runs as a process-wide manager with one isolated socket and auth folder
per tenant. After scanning the tenant-scoped onboarding QR, the customer must
choose one participating WhatsApp group before launch. Inbound gating and the
outbound transport both enforce that saved group; the group JID is only the
delivery address, while the explicit tenant `clientId` selects business context,
memory, tools, and the correct socket. Persisted sessions restore independently
after restart. See `docs/baileys-multi-user-testing.md` for the security model and
two-device acceptance test.

- **Identity**: `runAndDeliver`/`buildClientAgent` resolve a client from a
  "jid" string via `clientIdForJid` (`src/tenant-store.ts`). For WhatsApp that
  is a real JID looked up in the tenant table (or hashed, pre-auth). Telegram
  (and, later, Slack) instead pass a synthetic address encoded by
  `src/channel-address.ts` — `agent-client:<clientId>:<channel>:<channelAddress>`
  — which `clientIdForJid` decodes directly, short-circuiting the WhatsApp
  lookup. This is what lets a Telegram conversation share the client's
  existing profile/role/connections/session memory without a schema change.
- **Transport**: `src/whatsapp-transport.ts`'s `WhatsAppTransport` interface
  (`sendText`/`sendImage`/`sendVideo`/`sendAudio`/`sendDocument`) is
  channel-agnostic in shape; `src/telegram-transport.ts` implements it against
  the raw Telegram Bot HTTPS API (`src/telegram-client.ts` — no SDK
  dependency, plain `fetch`/`FormData`).
- **Connecting a bot — two supported models**:
  1. **Shared platform bot (self-serve, recommended)**: set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
     to one bot you own; the dashboard (`src/dashboard.ts`, wired in
     `callback-server.ts`) shows a "Connect Telegram" button that opens
     `t.me/<bot>?start=<signed clientId>` (`src/telegram-shared-bot.ts`). The
     signature reuses the same HMAC helper as onboarding links
     (`signClientToken`/`verifyClientToken` in `onboarding/client-link.ts`).
     Tapping Start sends `/start <token>` as the chat's first message; the bot
     verifies it and binds that chat to the client (`bindSharedTelegramChat` in
     `telegram-store.ts` — a global chatId→clientId index at
     `store/telegram-shared-chats.json`, plus `ClientMeta.telegramChatId` as a
     forward pointer for the dashboard's connected/not status).
  2. **BYO per-client bot**: each client brings their own bot (BotFather
     token). There's no self-serve UI for this path — an operator runs
     `npm run connect:telegram -- <clientId> <botToken>`
     (`scripts/connect-telegram.ts`), which validates the token and stores it
     encrypted at `store/clients/<clientId>/telegram.json`
     (`src/telegram-store.ts`, same vault as OAuth tokens). The bot locks
     itself to whichever chat messages it first (`ownerChatId`) — a
     personal-assistant lockdown mirroring Baileys' "home group" binding.

  Both models funnel into the same `deliverTelegramMessage` (`telegram.ts`)
  once a chat is bound to a clientId, so the reply/media/scheduler behavior is
  identical either way.
- **Runtime**: `src/telegram.ts` exports `runTelegramPollLoop`, a shared
  `getUpdates` long-poller. `src/telegram-manager.ts`'s
  `TelegramSessionManager` (mirrors `BaileysSessionManager`) runs one poller
  per BYO-connected client at boot; `src/telegram-shared-bot.ts` runs a single
  poller for the shared bot, if configured. Both are started from
  `src/index.ts`, and errors in one client's/bot's loop don't affect another's.
- **Caveat**: the connect link never expires (same as the existing
  `onboardingUrlFor` links) — a leaked link binds whoever taps it. Fine for
  now given it mirrors an already-accepted pattern in this codebase; revisit
  if Telegram connect links start getting shared outside a 1:1 context.
- **Slack**: multi-tenant — each client installs your Slack App into their own
  workspace via a "Connect Slack" dashboard button (OAuth v2,
  `src/slack-oauth.ts`). `state` reuses the same `signClientToken` HMAC helper
  as the Telegram deep link. `src/slack-client.ts` is a minimal Web API client
  (fetch-based, same no-SDK rationale as Telegram) including Slack's 3-step
  external file upload flow. Inbound DMs arrive at a single
  `POST /webhooks/slack/events` (`src/slack.ts`), signature-verified per
  Slack's request-signing spec, deduped by `event_id` (Slack retries
  deliveries), and resolved to a clientId via `team_id` →
  `slack-store.ts`'s reverse index (`store/slack-team-index.json`) —
  mirroring the Telegram shared-bot's chat index. Only 1:1 DMs are handled
  (`channel_type === 'im'`), matching Telegram's owner-only lockdown; bot's
  own messages are filtered via `event.bot_id` to avoid reply loops. Requires
  a Slack App you create at api.slack.com/apps — see `.env.example` for the
  exact Redirect URL / Event Subscriptions URL to configure there.

## Scheduler

The Strands SDK is request-driven and has no time-based scheduler, so cadence is an
app-layer concern (`src/scheduler/`).

```
ScheduledJob (store/clients/<clientId>/schedules.json)
  └─ { jid, title, prompt, schedule: cron|once, templateId?, enabled, lastRunAt, runCount }

runner.ts   — ticks every 30s, finds due jobs (timezone-aware cron, no deps),
              and runs each through the shared delivery path → proactive WhatsApp message.
cron.ts     — minimal 5-field cron evaluator (ranges, lists, *​/n steps, Vixie OR-semantics),
              matched against wall-clock minute in the client's timezone (AGENT_TIMEZONE).
templates.ts— per-role use cases (weekly digest, daily ROAS, content calendar, …).
tools.ts    — schedule_task / list / cancel / pause tools the agent uses live in chat.
```

Two ways jobs are created:
- **In chat** — the agent calls `schedule_task` ("remind me every Monday at 9"). The live
  WhatsApp JID is known, so delivery always targets the right chat.
- **In onboarding** — selected templates are stored on `role.json.scheduleTemplates` and
  materialized into live jobs (idempotently) the next time that client's agent is built.

### Onboarding Routes

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/api/onboarding/bootstrap[?c=<token>]` | Typed client bootstrap, saved choices, and server-derived readiness |
| GET | `/api/onboarding/status` | Current connections, WhatsApp verification, and readiness for live updates |
| POST | `/api/onboarding/profile` | Validate and save the business brief |
| POST | `/api/onboarding/preview` | Return a cached AI/fallback first-value preview for the saved profile |
| POST | `/api/onboarding/events` | Accept an allowlisted, privacy-safe activation event and forward best-effort to PostHog |
| POST | `/api/onboarding/role` | Save the specialist; changing it resets the routine decision |
| POST | `/api/onboarding/automations` | Save the explicit recurring-job selection, including an empty selection |
| POST | `/api/onboarding/whatsapp-provider` | Save the WhatsApp setup after prerequisite validation |
| POST | `/api/onboarding/whatsapp-disconnect` | Disconnect a linked client-owned device and return to recovery |
| GET | `/onboarding[?c=<token>]` | Adopt signed client link, then redirect to current step |
| GET | `/onboarding/step/:n` | Render step N (1 Profile, 2 Role, 3 Automations, 4 Connect, 5 Link, 6 Ready) |
| POST | `/onboarding/step/1` | Save business profile |
| POST | `/onboarding/step/2` | Save role choice |
| POST | `/onboarding/step/3` | Save chosen automations to `role.json.scheduleTemplates` |

| GET | `/onboarding/qr-stream` | SSE stream of QR updates |
| GET | `/onboarding/status` | JSON: `{ step, connections, whatsappLinked }` |

Activation events are also retained as a bounded atomic record under each client
directory. Properties are fixed to low-cardinality phase, step, platform, outcome,
duration, and preview-source values; profile text, URLs, prompts, phone numbers,
credentials, and OAuth data are never accepted. Successful message delivery marks
`first_agent_output_delivered` from the server-side delivery path.

### Client key (web ↔ runtime)

The runtime keys every client by `clientIdFromJid(jid)` (sha256 of the WhatsApp JID),
but a web onboarding session has no JID of its own. To bridge them, the agent sends each
un-onboarded client an onboarding link carrying their **HMAC-signed JID** (`?c=<token>`,
signed with `MEDIA_SIGNING_SECRET`; see `onboarding/client-link.ts`). On first load the
session adopts `clientId = clientIdFromJid(jid)`, so the profile, role, automations, and
platform tokens all save under the same key the agent reads at message time. Without a
signing secret the link falls back to a session-keyed flow (web setup won't reach the
runtime — fine for local demos).

The same signed token is passed as the OAuth `state` on every platform connect. The
callback verifies it (`verifyClientToken`) and keys the saved token by the client it
encodes — binding the token exchange to that client and protecting against CSRF. A state
that is neither a valid signed token nor the current session id is rejected.

## Native CRM

Every authenticated tenant has a native customer workspace at
`/dashboard/pipeline`, with plain-language People, Opportunities, and Follow-ups
screens. The home dashboard reads the same persisted summary; the WhatsApp agent
receives the same tools regardless of the selected business goal.

CRM state is stored in `store/clients/<tenantId>/crm.sqlite` by
`src/crm/store.ts`. SQLite WAL transactions make a record change and its immutable
activity entry one operation. Schema version 1 is recorded in `PRAGMA user_version`;
the store refuses a newer schema rather than guessing. Every statement includes
`tenant_id`, even though production also uses one database file per tenant.

The first-release stages are fixed: New lead, Contacted, Replied, Qualified,
Proposal sent, Won, and Lost. There are no delete routes. Completing a follow-up
retains it; edits and stage/value changes append history. Email, phone, activity
text, and attribution evidence use the existing AES-256-GCM vault. Keyed HMAC
hashes support exact email/phone deduplication without storing searchable
plaintext. Losing or rotating `AGENT_MASTER_KEY` without migration makes those
fields unreadable, just like existing OAuth secrets.

### Authority and attribution

- Normal creation, notes, active-stage movement, and follow-up actions are
  reversible customer-authorized operations.
- Won/Lost transitions and monetary-value changes require an explicit
  confirmation. The conversational tools use the persisted approve-before-act
  contract; dashboard mutations require `confirmed: true` from an explicit form.
- Won value means only the sum of opportunities a customer explicitly marked
  Won. It is not a forecast or a BizzClaw revenue claim.
- Attribution is `verified`, `influenced`, or `unknown`. Verified requires stored
  evidence. Influenced is deliberately non-causal and never rendered as
  “generated revenue.”

### Protected routes

All routes resolve the tenant exclusively from the better-auth session; no CRM
request accepts a tenant id from the browser. Mutations require same-origin JSON
and a 64 KiB body limit.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/dashboard/pipeline` | Responsive opportunity board and truthful totals |
| GET | `/dashboard/pipeline/people` | Search and add leads/customers |
| GET | `/dashboard/pipeline/follow-ups` | Due-date ordered next actions |
| GET | `/dashboard/pipeline/opportunities/:id` | Outcome, value, evidence, and immutable history |
| GET | `/dashboard/pipeline/people/:id` | Person detail and linked opportunities |
| GET/POST | `/api/crm/contacts` | Tenant-bound list/create |
| GET/POST | `/api/crm/opportunities` | Tenant-bound list/create |
| GET/POST | `/api/crm/follow-ups` | Tenant-bound list/create |
| PATCH | `/api/crm/contacts/:id` | Edit a person without deletion |
| PATCH | `/api/crm/opportunities/:id` | Edit, move stage, or confirm value |
| POST | `/api/crm/opportunities/:id/notes` | Append an encrypted note |
| POST | `/api/crm/opportunities/:id/attribution` | Record evidence state |

Agent tool arguments are observability-allowlisted. Contact details, search text,
notes, evidence, follow-up content, and monetary values are never copied into the
Agent Live activity database.

The `AgentSkills` plugin (from `@strands-agents/sdk`) handles progressive disclosure: skill metadata is injected into the system prompt on every invocation; full instructions are loaded on demand when the agent calls the `skills` tool.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `meta-ads-expert` | Campaign hierarchy, budget rules, audience targeting, creative specs, reporting workflow |

## Browser Tool

Gives the agent a real headless browser — navigate/read/click/type on any
site, gated by a per-client opt-in (`ClientMeta.webBrowsingEnabled`, toggled
from the dashboard's "Agent permissions" panel, not the platform-connection
registry — web browsing isn't an external account, it's a capability on the
agent itself).

Execution lives in a dedicated `browser-runtime` sidecar container (Puppeteer
+ `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth`, one shared Chromium process, one isolated
`BrowserContext` per active client), provisioned lazily and idempotently by
`src/browser-runtime-manager.ts` — same lifecycle pattern as the sandbox's
egress-proxy container. The host talks to it over an internal HTTP control
API (`src/browser/client.ts`) and exposes it to the agent via
`createBrowserTools(clientId)` (`src/browser/tools.ts`), wired into
`buildClientAgent` fail-soft: a `browser-runtime` outage silently omits the
tools rather than blocking the agent.

Interaction is primarily by **auto-indexed element** (`browser_view_elements`
numbers every visible interactive element; `browser_click`/`browser_type` act
by that number) so the agent can operate on sites it has never seen, with a
raw-CSS-selector escape hatch (`browser_click_selector`/`browser_type_selector`)
for sites it already knows. Every value read from a page — text, element
labels, screenshots — is wrapped as untrusted content
(`src/browser/untrusted-content.ts`) with a lightweight prompt-injection
pattern scan. Clicks that look irreversible (checkout, delete, unsubscribe —
`src/browser/risk.ts`) route through the existing approve-before-act
confirmation gate (`confirmations.ts`) instead of executing directly.

Credential-based login is now built: `browser_login({ domain })` resolves a
per-client, per-domain credential from an encrypted vault
(`store/clients/<clientId>/site-credentials.json`, AES-256-GCM via the
existing `vault.ts`) that is **only ever written from a signed-link web
form** (`/connect-site`, reached the same way onboarding links already work
— never from the agent or a WhatsApp message, making it structurally
impossible for a password to reach the model or chat history). A curated
registry (`src/browser-sites/registry.ts`) gives LinkedIn/Instagram/
Facebook/Reddit a known login URL; other domains fall back to a best-effort
`https://<domain>/login` guess. Login-field detection reuses the same
auto-indexed element list `browser_view_elements` already builds
(`src/browser/login-field-finder.ts`), not raw CSS selectors. The login
sequence screenshots the empty login form and delivers it to the client
before typing anything (transparency/credibility, and a phishing sanity
check), disables `browser_screenshot` for the client for the duration of
credential entry (`src/browser/vision-gate.ts`), and re-enables it
afterward — always, even if the flow throws partway through.

---

## Data Layer

All client data lives under `store/clients/<clientId>/`. `clientId` is SHA-256 of the WhatsApp JID.

### `profile.json`

## Agent Construction

`buildClientAgent(jid: string)` in `src/agent.ts`:

```
1. Derive clientId from JID (SHA-256)
2. Load profile.json → build <business_context> XML block
3. Load role.json → look up RoleDefinition in registry
4. Load connections.json → filter to role's MCPs where status === 'connected'
5. For each connected MCP: createClient() → connect() → listTools()
6. Apply limitHiggsfieldTools wrapper if higgsfield is in the tool list
7. Compose system prompt:
     BASE_PROMPT
     + role.systemPromptAddition
     + <business_context> block (also re-injected by BusinessContextPlugin hook)
8. Create AgentSkills plugin with role.skills paths
9. Create BusinessContextPlugin (re-injects context before each invocation)
10. Instantiate Agent({ systemPrompt, sandbox, tools, plugins })
```

---

## Asset Awareness

The agent knows about the client's internet assets through three layers:

### Layer 1 — Static injection (every invocation)
`BusinessContextPlugin` injects a `<business_context>` XML block into the system prompt via `BeforeInvocationEvent`. Always fresh — if the profile is updated mid-session, the next message picks it up.

```xml
<business_context>
  <name>Bloom Skincare</name>
  <industry>e-commerce</industry>
  <target_audience>Women 25-45, health-conscious, mid-to-high income</target_audience>
  <brand_voice>Warm, trustworthy, educational. Never pushy.</brand_voice>
  <goals>generate_leads, increase_roas, grow_instagram</goals>
  <assets>
    <website>https://bloomskincare.com</website>
    <landing_pages>https://bloomskincare.com/offer</landing_pages>
    <instagram handle="@bloomskincare">https://instagram.com/bloomskincare</instagram>
    <tiktok handle="@bloomskincare.official">https://tiktok.com/@bloomskincare.official</tiktok>
  </assets>
</business_context>

### Layer 2 — `business-context` skill
Attached to all roles. Teaches the agent *how to act on* the assets:
- Fetch and analyze landing page copy from the stored URL
- Read recent Instagram posts via the Graph API tools
- Cross-reference organic content performance with paid ad creative performance
- Suggest profile updates when the client mentions new assets

### Layer 3 — `get_business_context` tool
A lightweight inline tool created in `buildClientAgent`. Returns the full profile JSON on demand. Lets the agent re-read it mid-conversation and surface suggestions like "I notice your TikTok handle isn't saved — want me to add it?"
